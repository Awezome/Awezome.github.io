in Section.php addText function:
I did this:
// $givenText = utf8_encode($text);
$givenText = $text;

and in cell.php addText function

I did this:
// $text = utf8_encode($text);

There are many more places where this should probably be done, but I'm only using section.addText and Cell.addText in my application so that's the only places I needed to change.

Searching for utf8_encode found 19 matches in 7 files throughout the codebase.
If the developer could address this in the main codebase it would greatly help people.
The ironic thing about this problem is that the problem characters are coming from Microsoft Word in the first place!
